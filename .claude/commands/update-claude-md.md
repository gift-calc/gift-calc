# Update CLAUDE.md File

Review and update the CLAUDE.md file following 2025 best practices. The file should be:

## Key Requirements
- **Token-efficient**: Short, declarative bullet points (no long paragraphs)
- **Complete**: Include all essential project information
- **KISS principle**: Keep it simple and stupid - trim redundancy
- **Up-to-date**: Reflect current project state and dependencies

## Essential Sections to Include
1. **Tech Stack**: Core technologies, versions, dependencies
2. **Project Structure**: Key directories and files
3. **Commands**: All development/testing/build commands
4. **Code Style**: Important conventions and patterns
5. **Workflow**: Development process and review steps
6. **Custom Commands**: Available slash commands
7. **Do Not Touch**: Protected areas requiring approval

## Quality Checklist
Before finalizing, ensure:
- ✅ All commands are tested and working
- ✅ No redundant information
- ✅ Short, scannable format
- ✅ Current project state reflected
- ✅ Team workflow documented
- ✅ Token usage optimized

## Process
1. Read current CLAUDE.md and analyze project structure
2. Identify outdated or redundant content
3. Update with current project state
4. Verify all commands work
5. Test token efficiency
6. Validate completeness

Follow the principle: "This file is loaded as a prompt with every request" - make every token count.
